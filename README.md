# Cubework

This is my Elixir learning project. The end goal is to build a neural net
capable of solving a rubix cube. I've broken the process down as follows:

1. Creation of the cube

2. Establishing the rotation functions

3. Shuffling the cube

4. Creating fitness function
  Fitness = 1/(sum of the scalars of the vector difference between the
    expected coordinates and the solution coordinates.)

I'm nowhere near starting the neural net bits, but I'll get there.
