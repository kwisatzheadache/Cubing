This is my Elixir learning project. The end goal is to build a neural net capable
of solving a rubix cube. I've broken the process down so far to the following:

Creation of the cube
Establishing rotation functions
Shuffling the Cube
Creating a fitness function using the vector difference between the expected coordinates and the solution coordinates. 

Fitness = 1/(sum of the scalars) 


I'm nowhere near starting the neural net bits, but that will come in time.
